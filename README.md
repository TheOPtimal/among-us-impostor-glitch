# Among Us Impostor glitch

This script takes advantage of a glitch in Among Us that allows for higher chances of being impostor. Please note that this script only works on Linux systems with a 1080p display.

## Requirements

- A computer running Linux with Among Us installed
- A 1080p monitor
- `xdotool`

## Instructions

- Start Among Us
- Get inside a game of choice
- Open character customization menu
- Run this script
- When the game is about to start, hit Ctrl+C in the terminal
- You should have a good chance of being impostor.

NOTE: This script does NOT work in WSL without some funky workarounds (which I will not discuss here)
